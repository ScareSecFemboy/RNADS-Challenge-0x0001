# RNADS-Challenge-0x0001
Challenge notes for my cipher


# How the challenge will work 

User must find all of the following 

> Understanding of the cipher 
> Understanding of how the attack of the cipher works
> the first, second, and third plain text format of the password 
> Describe all stages of the cipher in your own words
> Describe the two attack methods in your own words 
> Write a description of how the cipher can be converted on paper 
> Write their own diagram of how we can easily prevent attacks on this cipher 
> Write a full report of the security issues with this cipher 


# Challenge structure

> Image named hahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahhahah.jpg is injected with a filename data.zip
> User must extract data.zip and extract all elements of that file in raw format meaning no files should be compressed 
> File contains 2 directories data1 and data2

> data1 is filled with 100+ files all txt files named filter_out_the_junk_____ where one of the files has a . in a part of the character 
an example being filer_out.the_junk_____________________ the file with the period is the file with information on the cipher 

> user runs binary file and attacks the cipher 
> from there user will grab data and try to find the number array assigned to values
